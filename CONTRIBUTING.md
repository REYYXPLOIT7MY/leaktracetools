# Contributing
Volunteer developers are highly needed, as I am the only developer keeping this project alive currently. New tools are always welcome.

Keep an eye at the [projects](https://github.com/users/ReyyXploit/projects/2) page to see if there is anything to do.

## Submitting changes
After you have forked the project and done your changes. Open an pull request and tell what have you changed, improved or added. Also, please follow the same coding style as the project is currently using.

Don't also write **random** commit messages, simply tell shortly in the message what you have done.

## Follow the copyright
Always add the copyright tag to new files. You can also add your own name to it.
