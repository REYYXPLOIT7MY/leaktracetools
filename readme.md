# Installation
I'll upload already built executables to the [releases](https://github.com/ReyyXploit/releases) tab, 
but I'd recommend installing the tool manually by following the instructions below. This way you also get the freshest version.

# Setup
Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

### Linux
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ReyyXploit`

2. Change directory `cd Leaktrace`

3. Run `sh setup.sh` in terminal to install the tool.

### Windows
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ReyyXploit`

2. Change directory `cd Leaktrace`

3. Run the `setup.bat` file.

Setup files will automatically build the tool as an executable.
You can also run the tool using `python leaktraceR.py` in the terminal.

Also, dependencies can be installed manually using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
